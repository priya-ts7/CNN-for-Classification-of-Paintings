Problem Definition:

This project designs and trains a CNN from scratch to perform classification of the painting images 
according to the style of painting.

The features learned by the CNN are studied in order to analyze the reason for misclassifications and 
identify potential approaches to improve performance of the network.


Dataset Description:

The data set being used in this project is the WikiArt dataset made available in Github. 
This dataset contains numerous paintings by various artists with different styles and belonging to different time periods.
Around 100,000 images of paintings, with varying dimensions, by 2,300 artists and belonging to 26 different styles are
available in this dataset.
The 14 classes are - Abstract_Expressionism, Art_Nouveau, Baroque, Color_Field_Painting, Cubism, Expressionism,
Impressionism, Naive_Art_Primitivism, Northern_Renaissance, Pop_Art, Post_Impressionism, Rococo, Romanticism, Symbolism.

Execution:

Data.7z contains the dataset used.
simpsal.zip is a folder containing the functions for 'saliency mapping'. Needs to be unzipped before execution.

project_code is the only file that needs to be executed.
